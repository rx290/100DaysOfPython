"""The epoch is the point where the time starts, and is platform dependent. For Unix, the epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). Write a Python program to find out what the epoch is on a given platform. Also convert a given time in seconds since the epoch. 
Sample Output:
Epoch on a given platform:
time.struct_time(tm_year=1970, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=1, tm_isdst=0)
Time in seconds since the epoch:
time.struct_time(tm_year=1970, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=10, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=1, tm_isdst=0) """
