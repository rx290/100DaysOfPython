Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using Pancake sort.
Pancake sorting is the colloquial term for the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size 
when a spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it. A pancake number is the minimum number 
of flips required for a given number of pancakes. The problem was first discussed by American geometer Jacob E. Goodman. 
It is a variation of the sorting problem in which the only allowed operation is to reverse the elements of some prefix of the sequence.
