Write a Python program to sort unsorted numbers using Patience sorting. Go to the editor
From Wikipedia:
In computer science, patience sorting is a sorting algorithm inspired by, and named after, 
the card game patience. A variant of the algorithm efficiently computes the length of a longest increasing subsequence in a given array.
The algorithm's name derives from a simplified variant of the patience card game. 
The game begins with a shuffled deck of cards. The cards are dealt one by one into a sequence of piles on the table, according to the following rules.
1. nitially, there are no piles. The first card dealt forms a new pile consisting of the single card.
2. Each subsequent card is placed on the leftmost existing pile whose top card has a value greater than or equal to the new card's value, 
or to the right of all of the existing piles, thus forming a new pile.
3. When there are no more cards remaining to deal, the game ends.
