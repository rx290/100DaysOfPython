"""
Write a Python program to sort unsorted numbers using Strand sort.
Strand sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that sorts items of a list into increasing order. 
It has O(n2) worst time complexity which occurs when the input list is reverse sorted. It has a best case time complexity of O(n) which occurs 
when the input is a list that is already sorted. Strand sort is not in-place as its space complexity is O(n).
