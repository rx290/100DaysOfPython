"""
Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the merge sort algorithm.
Note: According to Wikipedia "Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. 
Most implementations produce a stable sort, 
which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output."
