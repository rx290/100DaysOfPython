"""
Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using Cycle sort.
Cycle sort is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm, a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in 
terms of the total number of writes to the original array, unlike any other in-place sorting algorithm. 
It is based on the idea that the permutation to be sorted can be factored into cycles, 
which can individually be rotated to give a sorted result.
