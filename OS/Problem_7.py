File Modes:

r:   Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.

rb:  Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.

r+:  Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer will be at the beginning of the file.

rb+: Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer will be at the beginning of the file.

w:   Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.

wb:  Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.
