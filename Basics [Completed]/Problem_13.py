poem = "When some people talk about money\nThey speak as if it were a mysterious lover\nWho went out to buy milk and never\nCame back, and it makes me nostalgic\nFor the years I lived on coffee and bread,\nHungry all the time, walking to work on payday\nLike a woman journeying for water\nFrom a village without a well, then living\nOne or two nights like everyone else\nOn roast chicken and red wine.\n\n\nâ€”Tracy K. Smith"
