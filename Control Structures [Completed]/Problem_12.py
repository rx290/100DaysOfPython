"""
A certain grade of steel is graded accordning to the following conditions:

i.   Hardness must be greater than 50
ii.  Carbon content must be less than 0.7
iii. Tensile strength must be greater than 5600

The grades are as follows:

Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met.
Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met.
Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) are (iii) met.
Grade is 7 if conditions (i) are (iii) met.
Grade is 6 if only one conditions met.
Grade is 5 if conditions are not met.
