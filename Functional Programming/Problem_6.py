"""
Function floor can be used to round a number to a specific decimal place. The statement y = floor ( x * 10 + .5 ) / 10
rounds x to the tenths position (the second position to the right of the decimal point).
Write a program that defines four functions to round a number x in various ways which are as follows:

a)  roundToInt()
b)  roundToTenth()
c)  roundToHundredths()
d)  roundToThousandths()

for each value read, your program should print as follows:
The original value.
The number rounded to the nearest integer 
The number rounded to the nearest tenth
The number rounded to the nearest hundredth
The number rounded to the nearest thousandth
