"""
A parking garage charges a $2.00 min fee to park for up to three hours.
The garage charges an additional .5$ per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours.
The max charge for any given 24 hour period is 10$. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time.
Write a program that will calculate and print the parking charges for each of 3 customers who parked their cars in 
this garage yesterfay. You should enter the hours parked for each customer.
Your program should print the results in a neat tabular format and should calculate and print the total of yesterday's receipts.
The program should use the function calculateCharages() to determine the charge for each customer.
The output of the the code should be like this:

car     hours       Charges
1       1.50        2.00
2       4.00        2.50
3       24.00       10.00
total   29.50       14.59
