Ask user for an array input, then create a perfect shuffle for them and print that array.
Perfect shuffle is like this
Split the array into odd and evens then place two randomly odd and even number until you run out of elements

eg:

user: [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88]
perfect shuffle step 1: [11,33,55,77] [22,44,66,88]
perfect shuffle step 2: [11,55,22,66,33,77,44,88]
