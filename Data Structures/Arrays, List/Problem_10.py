Say there are two randomly generated array/lists of diffrent sizes.
Write a function which is like tis AddArr(a,n,b) where n is the length of array/list b to add to a.

for eg:

a = [2.2,3.3,4.4,5.5,6.6,7.7,8.8,9.9]
b = [6.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0]
add(a,5,b)

returns: [8.8,8.3,8.4,8.5,8.6,7.7,8.8,9.9]
