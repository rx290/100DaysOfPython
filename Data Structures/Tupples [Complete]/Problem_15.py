""" Write a Python program to calculate the average value of the numbers in a given tuple of tuples. 
Original Tuple:
((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))
Average value of the numbers of the said tuple of tuples:
[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
Original Tuple:
((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))
