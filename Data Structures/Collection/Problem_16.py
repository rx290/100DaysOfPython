"""
 Write a Python program to perform Counter arithmetic and set operations for aggregating results.   
Sample Output:
C1: Counter({1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1})
C2: Counter({4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1})
Combined counts:
Counter({4: 2, 5: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1})
Subtraction:
Counter({1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1})
Intersection (taking positive minimums):
Counter({4: 1, 5: 1})
Union (taking maximums):
Counter({1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1})
