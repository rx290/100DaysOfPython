# Introduction

    This is my python playground which is going to serve as my portfolio.
    My plan is to to add following stuff:

    1. Notes for topics which i'll revise or topics which i'll be learning from scratch
    2. Random code
    3. Portfolio projects
    4. Random Projects
    5. Educational Projects
    6. Conceptual Practice

## A Codefolio for my Pythoneer Roadmap
