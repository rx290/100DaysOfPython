<summary>  Other Libraries </summary>

    - [ ]  quart — an async web framework with Flask-compatible API. Some of the existing Flask extensions will even work!
    - [ ]  alibi-detect — monitor outliers and distribution drift in your production models, for tabular data, text, images and time      series.
    - [ ]  einops — popularized in 2020, einops lets you write tensor operations for readable and reliable code, supporting numpy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and others. Recommended by Karpathy, do you need anything else?
    - [ ]  stanza — accurate natural language processing tools on 60+ languages, from Stanford. Multiple available pre-trained models for different tasks.
    - [ ]  datasets — from HuggingFace, lightweight and extensible library to easily share and access datasets and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and more
    - [ ]  pytorch-forecasting — eases timeseries forecasting with neural networks for real-world cases and research alike.
    - [ ]  sktime — provides dedicated time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools for building, tuning, and evaluating composite models. Also check their companion sktime-dl package for deep learning based models.
    - [ ]  netron — a visualizer for neural network, deep learning and machine learning models. Supports more formats than I even knew existed.
    - [ ]  pycaret — wraps several common ML libraries and makes you vastly more productive, saving you hundreds of lines of code.
    - [ ]  tensor-sensor — helps you get the dimensions of your tensor math right, by improving error messages and providing visualizations.
