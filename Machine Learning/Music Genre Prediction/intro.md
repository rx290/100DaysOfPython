# Machine Learning

## Introduction

    A sub branch of AI where we train a model or an engine with a huge load of data to identify patterns and come up with a reasonable prediction or forecast based on those patterns.

    There are basic steps to create an ML program which are as follows:
        1. Import Data
        2. Clean data (remove duplicate, improper, incomplete and irrelevant data)
        3. Split the data into Training sets
        4. Creating a Model (Programing and choosing right architecture and algorithm)
        5. Training a Model
        6. Test a Model
        7. Evaluate the model
        8. Improve the model
        9. Deploy Model

## Prerequisite

    The libraries and software required for this project are as follows:
        1. Jupyter Notebook / Vscode
        2. Numpy (Multi Dimensional Array)
        3. Pandas (Dataframe library)
        4. MatPlotlib (2d Plotting library)
        5. Scikit-Learn (Machinelearning library)
